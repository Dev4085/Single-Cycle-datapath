Single-Cycle-datapath
This is an implementation of single cycle datapath of MIPS Architecture Computer Organisation and Design (The Hardware/ Software Interface) 4th Edition by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy. It is based on the Chapter 4 of the mentioned textbook.
The code works for add, addi, sub, and, or, slt, lw, sw, beq and j instructions.
The attached report contains the modelsim simulation results for a clock of 100 ns
